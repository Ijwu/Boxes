Boxes
=====

Made for Ludum Dare 31 Compo.

Click the screen to pull boxes towards your mouse. Try to get as many boxes as you can into the highlighted area. You get points for the boxes that make it and you lose points for those that don't.

Careful, though. Gravity changes every few seconds and the game will gradually get faster and harder.
